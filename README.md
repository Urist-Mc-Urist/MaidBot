# MaidBot
Discord Bot with chatGPT integration for fully automatic maidposting. The bot will automatically check the front page of Danbooru for new maid images. If a new proper victorian-style maid is found, it will post it to all the servers it's added to with a commentary based on tags generated by Deep Danbooru. Additionally the bot can be prompted at any time to search throught the Danbooru archives and post a new random maid image. The bot also supports basic chat functionality with through the OpenAI API.
